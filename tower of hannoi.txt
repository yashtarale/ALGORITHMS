Study, analyse and implement tower of hannoi where the aim it to more entire stack to another rod for n = 3 and understand the concept of recursion.
Algorithm

procedure hannoi(disk,source,aux,destination)
    if disk == 1 then
        move disk from source to destination
    else
        hannoi(n-1,source,destination,aux)
        move disk from source to destination
        hannoi(n-1, aux, source, destination)
    end_if
end_procedure



program

#include<stdio.h>
int towerOfHannoi(int n, char source, char aux, char destination) 
{
    if(n == 1)
    {
        printf("move disk from %c to %c\n", source, destination);
        return 0;
    }
    else
        towerOfHannoi(n-1, source, destination, aux);
    printf("move disk from %c to %c\n", source, destination);
    towerOfHannoi(n-1, aux, source, destination);
}
void main()
{
    towerOfHannoi(3,'A','B','C');
}


O/P:
    move disk from A to C
    move disk from A to B
    move disk from C to B
    move disk from A to C
    move disk from B to A
    move disk from B to C
    move disk from A to C
